<h2>My favorite movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
  Near perfect superhero film. The final chapters throw a little too much at
  you, but still a great film.
</p>
<h3>Seven Samurai</h3>
<p>A classic epic.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>If you don't know, you better watch. Samuel L Jackson is gigachad.</p>
